ArrayList<String> name=new Arraylist<String>();
//This following collection can hold many number of objects of String Type.
ArrayList<Flight> name=new Arraylist<Flight>(); //This collection is used for storing all the Objects created within the Flight Class.
//we can create other Primitive type of Array list as follows:
ArrayList<Integer> name=new Arraylist<Integer>();
